    "INPDescription": "Interaction to Next Paint (INP) is a pending Core Web Vital metric that will replace First Input Delay (FID) in March 2024. INP assesses responsiveness using data from the Event Timing API. When an interaction causes a page to become unresponsive, that is a poor user experience. INP observes the latency of all interactions a user has made with the page, and reports a single value which all (or nearly all) interactions were below. A low INP means the page was consistently able to respond quickly to all—or the vast majority—of user interactions.",
    "FCPDescription": "The First Contentful Paint (FCP) metric measures the time from when the page starts loading to when any part of the page's content is rendered on the screen. For this metric, content refers to text, images (including background images), svg elements, or non-white canvas elements",
    "TTFBDescription": "TTFB is a metric that measures the time between the request for a resource and when the first byte of a response begins to arrive"
